	<p class="passagetitle">An Assessment on John Proctor’s Beliefs and Morality</p>
	<p class="p1">In Arthur Miller’s play <em>The Crucible</em>, John Proctor stands out as a complex character. Throughout the play, John is presented as a manly farmer who is adamant in his own interpretation of the Christianity. He, though once committed adultery, possesses a firm moral principle, as he weights the genuine humanities of God more than the Church rules that are pedantically derived from the bible. His anti-mainstream moral identity is fostered and consolidated by his dislike toward the ugly natures of those people in power and the illogical church laws. As the witch hunt becomes more and more outrageous, John’s divergence with local church amplifies, which further cemented his moral standard. Eventually, in the final act, when he is challenged by the dilemma between honesty and his life, he heroically decides to retain his moral belief with the cost of his life. In fact, his decision comes with a hesitation, in which he undergoes an intensive moral struggle. He ultimately decides to trust himself. There are multiple forces that drove this dilemma and his final decision.

	<p class="p1">  Initially, when John Proctor is accused of witchcraft and captured solitary in the dungeon, he yearns to sacrifice his life for his good name. However, the introduction of Hale and Elizabeth offers him a new perspective. As Hale convinced Elizabeth that the “life is God’s most precious gift; no principle, however glorious, may justify the taking of it,”(Miller 132) she then goes on preaching to his husband to save his life. After learning the earnest will of Elizabeth, John’s belief is shaken by her devoted love. Under the empathy and guilt toward Elizabeth, John starts to prepare for his confession. However, telling this lie is not easy for him. His existing morality is so firm that it repels as soon as the idea of confession comes to mind, as he doubts, “is it evil, is it not? It is evil.” (Miller 138) Here, his decision of confession does not emotionally deliver him from sin, instead, it burdens him more. His hostility toward unreasonable judges confines him in the logic that telling a lie will not grant him salvation. As he repetitively calls out the words “fraud, pretense, lie”, he unconsciously reassures himself that his confession will be a sinful one, and the “gods in heaven” will judge him. Having this idea on his mind, followed by the entrance of Rebecca Nurse, John Proctor then heroically retracts his confession for his salvation and confronts his fate of death.

	As John’s morality is challenged by his confession, his decision goes on in a reversed direction. Rebecca the nurse, in John’s moment of self-doubt, enters and pulls him off the road of confession. When she cries out, “why, it is a lie, it is a lie,” (Miller 140) Rebecca consolidates John’s suspicion that he has made a false decision. John’s choice of retracting his confession is further reinforced when Danforth annoyingly asks him to sell his friends. The court trigger him, as he “cries out with hatred, ‘I have no tongue for it.’” (Miller 141) John, with disgust and hatred, becomes more concurred in the divinity of his own principle. He then believes that he cannot be served as a role model for his children and teaches “them to live like men” (Miller 143) if he is nailed to corruption. Eventually, when he is deciding between a sinful life and a sinless death, he, with deliverance and great pride, chooses the later one.

	 John Proctor is certainly a moral hero. Indeed, he is not a perfect model, but he has made a heroic effort in retaining the value he believes in. He gives up his life for honesty. His dedication to this moral value would certainly inspire many people to seek for a higher moral standard. As Elizabeth commends John, “he have his goodness now. God forbid I take it from him.” (Miller 145)
	</p>
	<p class="p1">
	However, despite John’s tremendous effort to preserve his belief, his mindset is narrow and obstinate. From modern perspective, Hale’s argument that life is the most important thing is wider accepted, and John’s decision would be described as stubborn and irresponsible. But if the historical setting and John’s agricultural background are taken into account, then his motivation becomes less unreasonable. At least his intention to preserve morality has already proven him a good person. 
	</p>
	<p class="p1">
	To conclude, John Proctor is a tragic hero. Even though his violation to adultery blemishes his character, his dedication to the virtue of honesty eventually makes him an admirable person. As he declares triumphantly after tearing the confession paper, “I do think I see some shred of goodness in John Proctor,” (Miller 144) he finally finds deliverance and is able to go in peace.
