	<p class="passagetitle">A Right to Die - A Moral Discourse On Active Euthanasia</p>
	<p class="p1">“Death is not the worst evil, but rather when we wish to die and cannot” wrote Sophocles a thousand years ago. Death has been the ultimate source of horror since the beginning of human existence. People are instinctively terrified by death not because the state of dying itself is gruesome, but rather the uncertainties and pains that come with it. However, as the modern technology develops in a high speed, many impossibilities have been made possible, and now the introduction of euthanasia has made death painless. Naming after the Greek word “good death,” euthanasia aims to relieve the suffering of patients who possess terminal disease or irreversible injury. The application of the euthanasia soon generated a heated discussion among people. Clearly, the morality of euthanasia is obscure, and people constantly debating for the right definition of it. At the heart of this heated debate, euthanasia has been categorized into two types, active and passive. Passive euthanasia generalized the situations when a patient is in irrecoverable unconsciousness or forever mentally disabled and only a removal of artificial life-support is needed to end his life, while active euthanasia describes a patient’s voluntary request for a lethal injection, and this is where all the debates occurs. It is a consensus that passive euthanasia barely violates any moral principle, and thus there should not be a moral burden in making a decision under those conditions. However, active euthanasia is more debatable due to its involvement of lethal injection, which blurred with the definition of killing. As far as I am concerned, active euthanasia does not stand the definition of killing, and it is a highly personal decision. Therefore, under certain circumstances, it is justifiable. 
</p>
	<p class="p1">
	The critics on active euthanasia often make use of deontologist point of view and argue that all forms of killing are unacceptable. Moreover, as Daniel Sulmasy points out, active euthanasia also goes against the Hippocratic oath (an oath regarding medical morality created by ancient sages) “a doctor will not give poison to anyone though ask to do so, nor will he suggest such a plan.” Beside those moral statements against euthanasia, Sulmasy also highlights that people are communal beings, “the value of human life is held in trust by a web of relationships,” and since the rejection of relationships is immoral, the suicidal decision of the patients cannot be justified. Instead, people should fight their lives to the end. No matter how bitter it may be, the presumption of life is always the only morally right option to choose. Such morality, as the critics believe, is the one that a society should promote. Therefore, active euthanasia is unjustifiable. 
	</p>
	<p class="p1">
	Despite the rationality of the counterarguments, it is, I believe, inappropriate to utterly deny the salutary effects and convenience of euthanasia simply based on a rigid doctrine of no-killing, especially when considering the complexity of the issue and variety of cases concerning euthanasia. As the world became increasingly modernized, the progressive idea of individualism appeared, people ceased to abide by religious doctrines and began to rethink the morality based on their own situations. By no means I am arguing for correctness of moral subjectivism, rather, I believe the moral collectivism refined through the awakening of individualism. That is to say, the no-killing rule is still tenable for the majority of cases, but in other cases, the rule should be reconsidered. As for active euthanasia, it is imprudent to define the injection as killing arbitrarily. I do not deny that fact that the operation of euthanasia eventually put someone to death, but the intention of the operation makes a difference. Euthanasia injection intend to relieve the suffering and pain of a patient instead of intending to take economical advantage of the patient. Moreover, with the absolute consent and affirmation from the patient, the doctor’s act differentiated from killings; the doctors should not feel the moral burden in executing such an act. Therefore, with the right intention and consent of the patient, the act of euthanasian injection is justified. 
	</p>

  <p class="p1">
	Another critique on euthanasia is regarding to the aspect of the patient, in which it points out that any suicidal decision is unacceptable. Again, I remain the standpoint that euthanasia is a highly personal decision. Act Utilitarian theory may well-explain the correctness of such a decision. It claims that the morally correct act is the one that creates the most utility. In cases of euthanasia, the decision of ending one’s life always creates the most utility. For one, euthanasia ends the suffering of a patient, especially when he knows his life will end in shortly, having the option of an early exit could serve, oddly, as a hope for the patient, Derek Humphry says. In addition, euthanasia reduces the economic burden on patients’ families. The treatments prolonging the lives of patient who have terminal illness are usually extravagantly expensive, and euthanasia would help reduce such expenses and the financial burden that put on the family. That is to say, the patient’s decision of receiving euthanasia may be justified by act utilitarianism. 
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
	Although the application of euthanasia may be justifiable, I do not say that everyone has moral right to make this decision. What differentiate euthanasia and suicide is not simply the painlessness of the process, but also the sanity of the person before his decision. Euthanasia can only be received by those who made a rational and planned decision of ending their lives, meaning that those with mental disorder are not qualified for euthanasia. That is to say, people who decide to receive euthanasia should clearly consider the effects of their deaths and should try their best to minimize the emotional suffering and economical inconvenience for their loved ones. Only when those criteria are fulfilled, a man or woman is granted the right to die. 
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
	In the end, I would like to reiterate my point that active euthanasia is an individual decision, no rule or doctrine should deprive one’s liberty to die. The operator of euthanasia should not be condemned of killing, for they are intending to help but not kill. And with the confident affirmation from the patient, the doctor ought not to be burdened by the rigid moral doctrines. Only under these conditions, active euthanasia is justifiable.

	<b>Annotated Bibliography</b><br>
	Humphry, Derek. “Why I Believe in Voluntary Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide.” finalexit.org. <em>ERGO!</em>,Norris Lane Press, 2 Jan, 2019. 11, Nov 2019<br>
	<em>In this article, the author, Humphry Derek, takes on an individualist point of view and argues for the correctness of voluntary euthanasia. He arranges his arguments into seven points to prove his central idea that assisted suicide, or self-deliverance, is a highly personal decision and it is therefore acceptable under certain circumstances. For example, if you have a painful terminal “illness or grave physical handicaps,” ending your life is ethical. To be more specific, the author draws a clear distinction between the suicide motivated by physical illness and the suicide urged by mental disorder, arguing that only “rational and planned suicide from a painful and hopeless disease which will shortly end in death” is justifiable, and the one caused by mental illness, on the other hand, is more likely to be an irrational decision, and therefore it is unjustifiable.
The argument of Humphry is helpful to me because it provides me with many solid arguments and examples that I can adapt in my essay. </em><br><br>
	
Sulmasy, Daniel P. "Death with Dignity: A Franciscan Doctor’s Perspective." <em>St. Anthony Messenger</em>(1996): 24-32. Print. <br>
<em>In this article, the author, Daniel Sulmasy, argues against euthanasia from a deontologist and religious point of view. He does not totally reject euthanasia, instead he makes clear that “allowing to die” is different from intending to kill. He avoided potentially the strongest utilitarian refutation by stating that “allowing to die” is ethical, and therefore it is okay to remove the artificial life support on a mentally dead person. However, the author argues that any form of killing, or any act that intent to end someone’s life, including injecting poisonous substances or prescribing death pills, is morally unacceptable. He states that first the act is against the Hippocratic oath, the moral standard for medical treatment, and second the act is also a denial of the intrinsic worth and outward relationship of an individual. Essentially the author is arguing that Euthanasia is both a form of killing and an act of suicide, which ought not to be promoted because it is not a “death with dignity.” Instead, he states that only when you fight your life to the last moment you can “die with dignity.”
The article is also helpful to me not only because it provides me with counter viewpoints on euthanasia, but also provide me with insight of a new moral logic which would polish my arguments.</em>
