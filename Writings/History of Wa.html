	<p class="passagetitle">History of Wa people in Ximeng China between 1941 to 1963</p>
	<p class="p2"><b>In August 2020, I spent a month in Ximeng China conducting an ethnogrpahy fieldwork around the Wa ethnic group. Although the trip was not long, I was able to have an immersive experience and meet a lot of interesting people.  </b></p>

	<p class="p1"><u>Introduction</u>
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">Wa is an ethnic minority group that occupies the region at the Sino-Burmese border, between Salween and Mekong rivers. Living in perilous mountains, the people of Wa remained autonomous for most of their history, which helped them develop distinctive languages, cultures, and beliefs that made up their unique Wa identity. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">Wa people did not start to develop senses of nationalities until the early twentieth century, when troops from neighboring powers arrived with guns, cannons, cars, rice, and missions to incorporate or subjugate. Like to the scramble of Africa, the Awa mountains were cut in half by British controlled Myanmar and China. A demarcation line drawn in 1941 marked the end of Wa’s autonomy, and now they had no choice but to choose a power to side with and be regulated under the national laws. For a primitive and historically self-sufficient ethnic group, this abrupt transition had an impact that was far beyond tremendous. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">During my fieldwork in Ximeng, I noticed a weird consonance in the narrative of Wa’s transition history. Specifically, the history between 1949 to 1963, after the establishment of Communist China to the dawn before the cultural revolution. Under Chinese propaganda, the narrative of this period of history focuses on the progressive changes brought by the communist party while omitting a local perspective. As a result, very few people nowadays still remember or understand what the older generation had gone through in those years of tumults. In this essay, I aim to examine the contemporary Chinese narrative on the liberating history of Wa people and, with the field researches and the previous scholastic researches I gathered during this short trip, try to construct a historical narrative exclusively from Wa’s perspective. I wish to do this not because I aim to threaten national security or racial unity, but rather to rescue a valuable piece of ethnic history from historical revisionism. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1"><u>An examination of the contemporary narrative</u>
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">China’s contemporary view uses a dichotomy that divides the Wa’s contemporary history into two parts: The pre-contact era and the post-contact era. The history of the pre-contact era focuses on how behind the Wa’s people were – poor infrastructures, unreliable medical systems, superstitious beliefs - while that of the post-contact era concentrates on positive social and economic changes under the communist China’s rule. Moreover, the year of 1958 serves as the sudden turning point of these two times. For instance, Ximeng Archive uses historical pictures of thatched cottages and naked children to portray the destitution before the communist party’s arrival. “Mao Cao Fang” and “Cha Cha Fang” (the name of the architecture style) became the connotation of its underdevelopment in the pre-contact age. For the post-contact period, the archive then provides dazzling statics of increasing per capita income and commendatory speeches of native people to illustrate the positive change brought by communist commissioners.
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">This narrative serves to nationalistic purposes. It justifies all the uncompromising involvement as aiding local progressions. The verb, liberate (解放), is commonly used to describe this period of communist action, creating a commendatory meaning to this period of history. In contemporary China, this narrative is widely equipped among official propaganda due to the targeted poverty alleviation policy posted by the central government. As a result of this politicization, many young Wa people accord their historical senses to this narrative. Ai Feng, for example, is an avid supporter of this narrative. When asked about the history of Wa’s liberation, he often explains with nationalistic pride, praising the communist party for leading Wa out of destitute. “The Guo Ming Tang (National Army) ruined our unity, the communist party and the great leader Mao united us,” he then added a story, “when a chief of Wa visited Beijing in 1958, he was stunned by the technological advancement and military power of Mao, he then returns and convinces Wa people to follow the glorious leadership of Mao. That is how we were liberated.” (Fieldnotes, 08/04/2020) Likewise, Ye Zi, a tourist guide of ours, possesses a vague uncertainty to this period of history, something that is contrasted to her fluent expertise on Wa’s ancient traditions. When asked about how Wa people reacted to the divide between China and Myanmar, she ambiguously states that “the good people followed China, while the bad guys ran.” (Fieldnotes, 08/02/2020). 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">Admittedly, this narrative contributes to racial unity and regional stability. However, it also has a suspicion of historical revisionism as it intentionally omits the local repulsions to the communist government’s interventions. For example, in mainstream narrative, the term “year of 1958” (Wu-Ba-Nian) is conceived as the glorious moment when “headhunting is eventually abolished and when Mao shook hand with the Wa representative” (Fieldnotes, 08/04/2020). However, for people who underwent the history, “year of 1958” has a notable undertone. It represents a time when the local mistrust toward the communism was at highest due to its drastic policy changes. In 1958, the public outrage to the policy change peaked, and several violent revolts broke out in villages such as Ma San and Pa Qiu. In the span between 1958-1963, more than twenty percent of Wa families had emigrated to Myanmar. [1] The details about these events are mainly undocumented in the mainstream narrative as it possesses a degree of political sensitivity. In an interview with Sui Ga, a ninety-three years old county magistrate who lived through the Wu-Ba-Nian, he intentionally shuns the question about what happened at that time. “It was a long story. Let’s not dig into it today” (Fieldnotes, 08/12/2020)
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">The Wa people underwent an uncertain time during mid-twentieth century, but mainstream history failed to acknowledge what they had gone through. The transition history was revised to fit into the progressive narrative, as it glorified the progression made by Wa’s society while ignoring all the blood, tears, and fears of Wa people when facing these horrifying uncertainties. In the following section, I will reproduce the Wa transition history from a native perspective without judgment or condemnation.
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1"><u>1941-1957 “Pre-Contact” Era</u>
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">In the late nineteenth century, the Wa people started seeing an increasing number of outsiders entering the Awa mountain. The British-controlled-Myanmar first entered the region and introduced guns and opium agriculture to the natives. [2] Myanmar did not carry out a borderline commission until 1941 when China was under the Sino-Japanese war pressure. After the demarcation line was drawn, the border remained penetrable to Wa people. People were allowed to swing across the border freely. [3] As both British-controlled Myanmar and China were under the pressures of wars, the Wa remained mostly autonomous. The indigenous people were able to resume their native traditions without legal consequences. For example, headhunting continued to be performed. [4]
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">Things started to heat up in the late 40s. The world wars were over. Myanmar gained independence from Britain. Communist party founded New China. The national army was losing the civil war and fled to the Sino-Myanmar border. That was when the presence of troops started to increase in the Awa mountain. “British troops would be right there. Burmese troops were on that mountain. Guo-Ming-Tang (National army) would be over there, and Jie-Fang-Jun (People’s Liberation Army) would enter from there.” (Fieldnotes, 08/12/2020) Sui Ga pointed at different mountains while explaining the situation back then. It was not clear whether his talk was historically accurate, but it was clear that the time was full of military involvements, which foreshadows the pending conflicts, violence, and changes that the people of Wa were about to experience. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">After New China was founded in 1949, the Liberation army joined the arena of Ximeng in order to exterminate the national army. Before the arrival of the Liberation army, the national army maintained a neutral relationship with the locals. “They do not attack us if we did not attack them” Ai Bing described (Fieldnotes, 08/09/2020). However, there was still an indigenous fear toward those newcomers. The parents often analogize the national army with the local bandits and use it as a trick to intimidate the children into obedience. [5] Eventually, the no-contact strategy adopted by the national army put them in a disadvantageous position when competing for the locals’ favor. When the communist Liberation army came with greater numbers of people and goods, the locals naturally sided with communist China. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">The contemporary narrative tends to portray the Liberation soldiers as savior figures. To some extent, this is true. The national army came to Ximeng with guns and revengeful hearts, while communist China came to Ximeng with foods and technologies for ingratiating the locals, hoping to win their support for the newly found China. As Sui Ga recalled in his memoir, “My family had always been friendly to the Liberation army. My dad would give them sugarcane and bananas whenever they came to visit, and they would invite my family to the New year dinner in the military camps” (Sui 15-16). He also described his first encounter with the Liberation army, “When they came, I was having serious malaria. My illness was so intensive that I was locked in a room and expected to die soon, but the Liberation soldiers came to me with pills and vaccine, which saved my life” (Sui 18).
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">In the 50s, the Liberation army established a friendly relationship with the locals. The locals were gradually accepting the notions of communism under the gentle and steady transitional policies. The social structure, economy, and local traditions were changed through numerous communications. For example, communist commissioners gathered the chiefs from eight villages in Ximeng and established a friendly league to alleviate the tensions between villages, which consensually ended the tradition of headhunting. [6] Although there were transient episodes of mistrust among the natives, the Liberation army handled them with care and talked it out through friendly conversations. It was a hopeful time for the Wa people in Ximeng.
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1"><u>1958 – 1963</u>
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">1958 is when the Great Leap Forward initiated, and communist-controlled Ximeng was not exempted from this leftist movement. Due to the drastic policy changes, the accumulated reputation of the Communist party among the locals collapsed, and the natives were confronted with frustrating uncertainties about their fate. Their fear and mistrust toward the communist party peaked. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">The sudden policy changes generated wide-spread frustration among Wa people. In 1958, the regional Communist office put forth “Three bans and one confiscation” (三禁一收) policy, by which it aims to ban headhunting, lynching and opium production, and confiscate the personal firearms. It also put forth the goals of “Double Leap Forward” (双跃进), which aims to confiscate all personal food and establish a public free-for-all dining hall. People’s reactions were vehement, especially to the decisions on firearm and food confiscation. The agitated sentiment was not hard to comprehend. “Many people do not understand the purpose of this decision. Not many people were ready to make such devotion.” Sui Ga explained in his memoir, “If the commissioners adopt a gentler strategy, making more conversation with the people rather than rushing to confiscation, I believe people will follow without hesitation.” (Sui 36) 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">Immediately after the policy was announced during a meeting, eight people fled to Myanmar. The frustrations later developed into a wide-spread panic, generating violent upheaval in many places. When the policies were announced, most people were in a speculating position. The public outrage intensified when many village chiefs were arrested and condemned as Rightists. In states of panic, more than ten thousand Wa people escaped to Myanmar, including many siblings of Sui Ga. As Sui Ga’s fiancée recalled, “the situation was chaotic, and people were in an irrational state of panic. People were so panicked and worried that many forced others to emigrate along with them.” (Sui 40-41) In September, violent revolts broke out in Ximeng. Many were killed. More people escaped to Myanmar. Ximeng became a ground of chaos.
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">The violence settled in the winter of 1958, but the Great Leap Forward’s impact continued to reign, causing a wide-spread famine among the working class. Seeing the apparent failure, the communist party reflected and adjusted the transition policy back to a more conservative one. In 1963, the economy regained stability, and many Wa emigrants who left their homeland in 1958 were able to return to Ximeng. [7] Everything seemed to be back to normal. However, another leftist movement, the Cultural Revolution, was on its way. From 1966 to 1976, Wa’s land was again rendered with violent fanaticism and a series of “witch-hunts”. Nevertheless, that will be another story. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1"><u>Conclusion</u>
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">“History,” harmless history, where everything unexpected in its own time is chronicled on the page as inevitable. The terror of the unforeseen is what the science of history hides, turning a disaster into an epic.” [8] In becoming a part of communist China, Wa people have gone through uncertain times and have made tremendous changes. The contemporary narrative glorifies and commends the progress, but no one has ever praised the unyielding, tenacious Wa people who lived through this tumultuous history.
