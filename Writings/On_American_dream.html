	<p class="passagetitle">On American Dream - A Review for Tales of Two Americas</p>
	<p class="p1">“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,” wrote Benjamin Franklins in the declaration of independence, envisioning America to be an unprecedented nation that established on the principles of love and inclusiveness. This insightful vision continually served as an ultimate goal of the United States and incessantly conducted the growth of the nation in the streams of American history.  The good name of this inclusive vision, the American Dream, soon spread across the globe, luring admirers from all over the world, who traveled from afar in search of a place where “the opportunity is real, life is free, equality in the air they breathe.”But the American Dream, as plastic as it sounds, was only an advertisement of the nation, and the realities were often more complicated than those ideals. In two pieces of writings, a poem written in the early twentieth century by Langston Hughes, <em>Let America Be America Again</em>, and a contemporary essay by Thomas Egan,<em> We Share the Rain, and not much else</em>, the theme of American dream has been presented in utterly different ways, which implies the change in the attitude regarding American dream. The poem was written with a high spirit, passionately championing for the revival of American dream, while the essay was written in an oddly passive tone, stoically pointing out the social problems that underrate the American dream. What happened to American Dream in this hundred-years lapse? Do they still exist? What did they become? The answers lie within the passages.</p>
	<p class="p1">
	As early as in the times of Langston Hughes, people had already realized the truth that the United States was still far from being the one people dreamed. As Hughes dismayingly wrote in his poem, American dream has been lost, people who earnestly searched for their dream land will eventually be defeated by the cruel reality, and finds only “old stupid plan of dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak” and the “ancient endless chain of profit, power, gain, of grab of land.” However, no matter how depressing the reality was, Hughes did not lose faith in those American ideals. “Let America be the dream it used to be. Let it be the pioneer on the plain seeking a home where he himself is free.” Hughes’ poem, brimming with optimism, reminded people of the vision that America was founded on and he passionately calls for the reinvigoration of such spirit. His ardent words, like a lighthouse in a stormy night, illuminated a path for America at a very dark time. Written in 1936, prelude to World War II, when the tensions among nations was gradually increasing, the poem inspired the Americans to get away from overwhelming affairs temporarily and contemplate on the common goals and dreams of the nation, uniting people together, and preparing them for a challenging time ahead. Although American was never the most ideal version of America to Hughes, he firmly believes that “America will be!” Although America has not yet become the wonderland which people dream of, this great optimism and faith toward the nation shown by Hughes’ poem has already proven the existence of American dream. The American dream is not only a search for a perfect system, but a belief that everything is changeable through hard work, a kind of optimism toward the nation. So, when Hughes, instead of being defeated by the racial injustice and economic inequality, decides to earnestly call for change, can’t we call this unyielding faith a manifestation of American dream? That is to say, although the social problems in Hughes’ times were in multitude, the American dream can still be found in people’s confidence in overturning hindrances and their determination of creating a better country.

	America has been through countless things after the poem was published, and the American dream has also been transforming and reshaping along with the growth of the nation. What is it like now? Timothy Egan provides his answer in his Essay, <em>We Share the Rain, But Not Much Else</em>. As melancholy as the title sounds, the essay was written in a bitterly nostalgic tone, comparing the social changes in Seattle to the good old days of the city. Unlike Hughes, Egan presents the social problems such as income inequality and social segregation in a stoic tone, without passion to make change. As he as-a-matter-of-factly states that “somebody has to pull the lever whether we are in the market for cars in Japan or window seat on an airplane,” and the “politicians zooms through the city in a security cocoon to a rich person’s home, Seattle as an ATM. The public, regular folks, are not engaged,” It seems like he is almost directly answering to Hughes' call in a neglecting way, denying the possibilities of change in society. However, Egan’s passive response has his reason. As the society became more modernized, the social system also became more rigid. The wide range of possibilities and opportunities was narrowed by the development of the nation, as nowadays, education seems to be the only door for a person to achieve financial success. The more mature the system grows, the more inflexible it becomes, and therefore the class segregation gradually factualized. The acceptance of those facts limits the height of American dream. The irresistible reality slowly defeats people’s urge and confidence to make changes. The high spirit in creating a better nation gradually diminished. That is why Egan display preference to the old days even though “life was harder back then, when racial segregation and conservative gender role prevailed”. That is to say, the more people realize the complexity of the society, the more they are likely to lose faith in their individual power to make change. And this is one of the major factors that American spirit is declining in modern days.

	Despite the declining optimism among the public, the American dream did not totally vanish. Certainly, the idealistic belief that anyone could do anything was gone, but the spirit and hope of doing goods prolonged. As at the end of the essay, Egan exemplified many organizations in Seattle working hard to help the poor around the world, such as Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Microsoft. The American dream shape-shifted to a different form, but still inspires people to make a better world. 
  </p>
  <p class="p1">
	To conclude, the vivacity of American dream has been fluctuating throughout American history. Clearly, it had its high points and its low points, but it has never vanished. Based on the principles of inclusion and liberty, American dream serves as the foundation of the country, constantly inspiring many generations to resolve social problems and build a better nation, despite the impediments and hardships.
