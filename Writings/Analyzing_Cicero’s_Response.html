	<p class="passagetitle">Analyzing Cicero’s Response to Milo’s Manumission of Slaves in Pro Milone</p>
	<p class="p1">
        In January of 52 BC, Milo's slaves killed Clodius on the Appian Way. To defend Milo, Cicero argued that Clodius had waylaid Milo, framing the murder as an act of self-defense. However, Asconius wrote that the encounter between the two parties was casual, with neither side planning an ambush. Only after the conflict did both Milo‘s and Clodius's parties seize the opportunity to claim that the other had set an ambush. </p>

        Cicero initiates his refutation by challenging the appropriateness of employing torture in Milo's case. He emphasizes that torture is designed to investigate the perpetrator of the murder (<em>coniectura</em>), and in Milo’s case, the perpetrators of the murder are evident.  Cicero contends that the crux of the matter lies in determining whether the murder was executed rightfully or justly (<em>qualitas and translatio</em>). To present this point, Cicero employs the rhetorical technique of <em>ratiocinatio</em>, posing self-addressed questions and working through his responses with the audience. Throughout the refutation, a series of rhetorical questions, such as "Why did Milo free the slaves? Why is there a need for torture? Did they kill him?" guide the audience to his point that torture is unnecessary in this case, as Milo’s slaves had already admitted to the killing. The pivotal question becomes whether the murder was done <em>iure an iniuria</em>, a matter for the court to decide. This strategic use of rhetorical questions serves as a roadmap for the audience to meticulously follow Cicero's line of reasoning, implicitly highlighting the distinction between what can be determined through torture and what requires the court's judgment. These ratiocinatio questions not only engage the audience by prompting them to think about the same questions but also help Cicero establish credibility as an orator, as he demonstrates thoughtfulness by responding before the audience can formulate answers themselves. Thus, the method of guiding the audience through rhetorical questions not only engages them but also fosters a sense of trust for Cicero as a speaker.

        Another notable feature in Cicero's refutation is Shadow Boxing, in which he anticipates the questioning of an imaginary skeptical opponent and responds with well-thought-out answers. After explaining why Milo’s slaves won the ambush, Cicero smoothly transitions into explaining the manumission of Milo’s slaves before the question arises in the audience’s minds: <em>Cur igitur eos manu misit?</em> (57) By preemptively posing this question, Cicero captures the audience's attention and subtly guides them to the discussion that Milo released the slaves out of genuine appreciation for their deeds, and he spared them from unnecessary harm in a flawed procedure.

    <p class="p1">
        Having established an imaginary opponent in his narrative, Cicero culminates this shadow boxing match with a powerful meta-rhetorical punchline, directly ridiculing the accuser's line of thought: <em>Manu vero cur miserit, si id potius quaeris, quam cur partim amplis adfecerit praemiis, nescis inimici factum reprehendere</em> (57). Here, Cicero leverages his own credibility as the orator to propel his argument forward, strategically avoiding further discussion of why Milo set free his slaves. By critiquing the rhetorical abilities of an imaginary opponent, he showcases his rhetorical authority and shifts the focus of the speech to a sentimental appraisal of the slaves and an emotional rendering of their virtues.

    <p class="p1">
        Recognizing the challenge of proving Milo’s intention to emancipate the slaves, he adeptly pivots to appeal to the sympathy of his audience, suggesting that the slaves deserved rewards rather than torture for defending their master—a morally justifiable act. To strengthen this argument, Cicero begins by quoting Marcus Cato, a figure of enduring influence in Rome: <em>non libertate solum, sed etiam omnibus praemiis dignissimos fuisse, qui domini caput defendissent</em>(59). Building upon Cato’s words, Cicero presents the slaves as virtuous and deserving of recognition, highlighting their merits through a sympathetic and appreciative tone. He describes the slaves as <em>tam benevolis, tam bonis, tam fidelibus servis </em>(58). He also elevates the slaves with magnificent titles such as <em>conservatores domini, ultores sceleris, defensores necis</em>, highlighting their glory and worthiness of fair treatment. The use of rising tricolons, coupled with echoing assonance, amplifies the virtues of Milo’s slaves, leaving a lasting impression in the audience’s ears that these slaves are righteous and loyal individuals, who dared to risk their lives for their master. Therefore, by poetically stressing the goodness of the slaves, Cicero attempts to evoke sympathy among the audience, leading them to believe that it is unfair for these slaves to be tortured and that it was right and honorable for Milo to release them. To further reinforce this impression, Cicero illustrates the contrasting mistreatment of Clodius’s slaves.

    <p class="p1">
        In his final argument, Cicero uses the mistreatment of Clodian slaves to question the morality and credibility of torturing slaves against their masters.  He lay out his point through the mouth of the ancestor, stating that <em>maiores nostri in dominum [de servo] quaeri noluerunt, non quin posset verum inveniri, sed quia videbatur indignum esse et [domini] morte ipsa tristius</em> (59). By referencing the wisdom of the predecessors, Cicero borrows authority from a more trusted source to underscore the unworthiness of torturing slaves against their own master—an ineffective approach both in finding the truth and unjust to the slaves. To further emphasize the flaws of the practice and the dilemma faced by slaves, Cicero introduces the imaginary figure Ruffio, a Clodian slave, in a vivid illustration:<em> 'Heus tu, Rufio' (verbi causa) 'cave sis mentiaris. Clodius insidias fecit Miloni?' 'Fecit:' 'certa crux.' 'Nullas fecit:' ‘sperata libertas.’</em>(60) Cicero uses short rhetorical questions to theatrically depict the two possibilities confronted by an interrogated slave—either death for truth or hope for freedom through deception. By juxtaposing these questions, Cicero engages the audience in the emotional struggle faced by those undergoing torture, persuading them that, under such circumstances, individuals are incentivized to prioritize self-preservation over truth. This echoes Aristotle's remark in <em> Loci Communes</em>  that "for slaves do not lie any less when under compulsion, neither those who harden themselves not to tell the truth nor those who lie easily to stop the pain more quickly."(Aristotle Rhet. 1.15.26, tr. Kennedy) Having firmly established the flawed nature of testifying slaves against their master, Cicero concludes his refutation with an ironic question: "What could be more impartial or more unprejudiced than such a method of examination?" The sarcastic tone here invites the audience to critically reconsider the morality and effectiveness of such a practice in pursuing truth, consolidating his argument defending Milo’s emancipation. 
    </p>
    <p class="p1">
        To conclude, Cicero masterfully addressed the suspicion surrounding Milo's release of slaves through an engaging and almost parodic narrative. Initially, he shows that it was unnecessary for Milo’s slave to be tortured because they had already admitted the killing. Cicero then appeals to the audience’s sympathy, portraying Milo's slaves as honorable individuals who saved their master while emphasizing Milo's moral ground in sparing them from unnecessary hardship. Finally, to further challenge the necessity of torturing slaves against their master, Cicero compellingly illustrates the mistreatment of Clodian slaves. Throughout the speech, Cicero repetitively uses rhetorical questions and <em>ratiocinatio</em> in a colloquial and engaging manner. This not only helps him produce an eloquent response for Milo's decision but also helps him highlight Milonis’ virtues and blacken Clodians’ characters. The rhetorical strategy Cicero used in his refutation aligns with his overall approach in Pro Milone, effectively bolstering Milo's character while undermining the credibility and characters of those who accused him.
