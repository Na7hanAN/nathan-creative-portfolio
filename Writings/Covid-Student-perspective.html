	<p class="passagetitle">Covid-19: International students’ perspectives</p>
	<p class="p1">(This following news article is written for Red & White April Edition)</p>
	<p class="p1">As Covid-19 unmercifully breaks out in every corner on Earth, the cancellations of school and quarantining life have become realities for all of us. However, due to the differences of spread in different regions, Covid-19 impacts SG students, particularly those international students, differently. In fact, many of us did not accept the Covid-19 as a severe global pandemic until the trimester got moved online, while some others have been wrestling with this novel coronavirus since early January, following on the news update and planning on the right moves according to the changing situations. Certainly, many international students have made difficult decisions and underwent challenging adventures due to different governmental responses to the outbreaks. Thanks to the diverse SG community, we are able to hear those stories. 
</p>
	<p class="p1">
	The major impact posted by Covid-19 to international students is on their travel plans. Earlier in January when the virus began to spread in East Asia, many Chinese and Korean students cancelled their flights back home. However, when the face-to-face instruction was cancelled in early March, the international students from Asia were again being put in a dilemma. On one hand, since the outbreak in China and Korea had already reached a turning point in March, home is the safest place to be. On the other hand, traveling home also sparked numerous concerns: the place to live in the US, I20 expiration, the safety on the 12 hours+ flight, the travel ban from China to the US, the 14 days concentrated quarantine and so forth. For seniors, the decision was especially hard to make, since flying back home may signify an absolute goodbye to the place and people they loved. Due to the concerns, many have left the States and many have decided to stay. As situations in the States worsened quickly, students who hesitated to leave were confronted by a lack of flight and a soaring ticket price. Now as countries level up their controls on the population movement, it becomes almost impossible for international students to leave or come back to the States in the foreseeable future.

	<p class="p1">
	Locating in different time zones, international students also have to adjust their working schedules. It is a fact beyond doubts that SG has done an excellent job translating the classes online and training the faculties, the international students, nevertheless, were challenged by an adjustment of working habits. For students from European continents, the classes are moved to afternoon, and for those from Asia, the classes start at night. The adjustments are mostly easy to make, as many students get to sleep in every day. But there are also difficult cases. For those from South Korea, the online classes start at ten and end at midnight, as a result of which many Koreans are often exhausted during last class and unable to attend afternoon programs. After all, those are the extreme cases, and the hardship definitely pales when compared to those from the West Coast, who have to wake up earlier than their pets.

	Living in different countries, international students also experience different quarantines. For local students, quarantine may simply mean an exemption from social gathering and staying six feet apart from other people when walking dogs. But for many international students, quarantine means quarantine. Turkey shut down borders between major cities and banned people under twenty in public spaces. India ordered curfews and strict lockdown of the neighborhood. China, Egypt and Vietnam send passengers from international flight to concentrated quarantine sites for two weeks. The quarantining policies are particularly strict in China. Yes, the shops and restaurants have reopened, but this revival is supported by an extremely strict monitoring on the movement of dangerous population, the body temperature of pedestrians, and mask wearing law enforcement.

	<p class="p1">
	This Covid-19 outbreak is an unprecedented event for all of us. It unites people, but also exposes the shady area in humanity. The hatred caused by ignorance seems to be exaggerated under this global pandemic, and many Asian international students have directly or indirectly experienced racist convictions. For example, over spring break, Hojun Lee’21, from South Korea, got yelled at for not wearing a mask by a guy who is not wearing a mask on a bridge where no one is wearing a mask. The similar stories abound in our daily lives. Not to condemn the conduct without any understanding from their positions, the rising anti-Asian sentiment certainly unveiled our disunity between nations at this tumultuous time. Covid-19 is a global emergency, and the overlooked populations such those 50 million unemployed in India and those 3 million Syrian refugees in Turkey remains extremely vulnerable to the virus and could be the next epicenter of the outbreak after the States. It is important for all of us to leave the debate on the cause and look into the solutions together.
