	<p class="passagetitle">Mental Breakdowns: A Closer Look</p>
	<p class="p1">(The following article is an OpEd written for Red & White winter edition 2019)</p>
	<p class="p1">It was a year ago when I had a mental breakdown. Coming from a country that believes that exposing your emotion is a disturbance to others, I was untrained in communicating my feelings. As a result, I could not feel alleviation and interpersonal connection as I reached out to people. My frustration grew day by day.</p>
	<p class="p1">
	After an attempt to call to the Suicide Prevention Lifeline failed --- after being hung up on, with 153 people ahead of me in line --- I finally realized the only person who can help me is myself. That is when I started to learn about the mechanisms behind mental breakdowns. Hopefully my personal interpretation and tips can shine some light on those who are suffering from mental distress.
	</p>
	<p class="p1">
	First, I believe it is important to make the distinction that a mental breakdown is different from depression. A mental breakdown is an overload of negative emotions. It is brief, and often lasts for a few hours to a few days. But if your negativity prevails for more than two weeks, it’s important to go see a counselor.
	</p>

	<p class="p1">
	A mental breakdown is used to describe a period of intense mental distress. The causes range from lack of sleep to the death of loved ones. People experiencing a breakdown often tend to be stuck in a loop of negative thoughts, which generates an outburst of anger and anxiety, usually accompanied with tears. For example, when people are having a breakdown, they tend to exhibit thoughts of self-doubt: Why can’t I be like him/her? Why am I so ordinary? Why do my parents only care about my grades? Why is he/she not replying to my snaps? Why did he/she leave me? Why is he/she so mean to me? This self-questioning will bring continuous frustration to those who experience it. In the worst cases, these negative thoughts may evolve to depressive ideas such as a sense of hopelessness and worthlessness. So, here is the question: How can someone regain mental control amidst a breakdown?
	</p>
	<p class="p1">The first thing you need to do is get up from your bed or get out from your room and look at yourself in the mirror. Doing this will distract you from the negative thoughts and reestablish your self-awareness. Who will cry hideously in front of themselves, right?</p>
	
	<p class="p1">Once you have regained a bit of tranquility, you can move on to the next step: write down the feelings you have, and be as specific as you can. Mental breakdowns are often triggered by a combination of feelings, not just one single event. People sometimes listen to one voice too much that they overlook the specific reasons behind their breakdowns. Therefore, instead of saying you are upset, you can make a list of things that make you upset and why they make you upset. For example: I felt pressured because of the upcoming research paper. I felt frustrated because John Smith ghosted me. I felt guilty because I lied to my friends. I felt defeated because I lost to Aristo in the tennis game. The key is to be specific, and that is how you can prescribe a solution to each factor: I can make a study plan for the paper. I can talk to John in person. I can tell my friends the truth. I can work harder and beat Aristo in the next match. Once you have put your thoughts in place, I believe you will regain your composure.</p>
	
	<p class="p1">As people have different levels of mental sensitivity, everyone essentially has their own way to manage their emotions. But I hope that the method I have introduced can help those people who are having a bad time, especially seniors who are going through the stressful college process. Remember as Ernest Hemmingway once said, “A man can be destroyed, but can’t be defeated.” We should trust the tenacity of our minds and trust that the pain we suffer now will eventually make us stronger.</p>
