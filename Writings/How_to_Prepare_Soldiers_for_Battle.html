	<p class="passagetitle">How to Prepare Soldiers for Battle: Rhetorical Strategies of Calgacus and Agricola</p>

    <p class="p1">
​   ​Under Tacitus’ pen, Calgacus and Agricola appear to be charismatic speakers who both give courage, excitement, and incentives to their soldiers before battle. However, the commanders undertake different rhetoric strategies: Calgacus aims to incite aggressiveness of British soldiers by stressing the importance of this battle to their freedom, dignity, and safety, while Agricola encourages Roman soldiers by reminding them of their honor, unity and the pending glory of subjugating Britain.
</p>

<p class="p1">
    First, both commanders establish the tone of their speech at the beginning, as they each lay out the cause of war and remind their soldiers what they are fighting for. In the talk for British soldiers, Calgacus takes on an urgent tone, as he contends that the greedy Romans are coming, and there is no way for them to reconcile. He portrays the Romans as insatiable, greedy, and fundamentally intrusive, as he uses two anaphora to stress these qualities: <em>sī locuplēs hostis est, avārī, sī pauper, ambitiōsī, quōs nōn Oriēns, nōn Occidēns satiāverit: sōlī omnium opēs atque inopiam parī adfectū concupīscunt</em> (30.4). Here, the use of anaphora slows the narrative as it enumerates a series of conditions to emphasize Roman greediness. The repetition of <em>sī</em> highlights that the Romans are intrusive and unempathetic toward others, and the repetition of <em>nōn</em> stresses that the avarice of Romans drives them to endless conquering. By establishing their enemies as an insatiable race, Calgacus emphasizes how Romans severely threaten their safety and freedom. The sense of urgency created by this tone would incite combativeness within the soldiers as they have no choice but to fight the Romans.
</p>

<p class="p1">
    In contrast to the urgent tone of Calcagus, Agricola adopts an optimistic one. Roman soldiers are mainly concerned with the glory of conquering Britain, a prize they have longed for through their long journey. Thus, in Agricola’s pep talk, he excites the soldiers by asserting that they have already conquered Britain, as he says: <em>fīnem Britanniae nōn fāmā nec rūmōre, sed castrīs et armīs tenēmus: inventa Britannia et subācta</em> (33.3). In this phrase, <em>nōn fāmā nec rūmōre</em> and <em>castrīs et armīs</em> juxtaposes to form an antithesis of the past and present of their British control. The contrast reveals to soldiers that they made a significant difference during their conquest and changed the state of governance in Britain from weak consensus to tangible subjugation. This assertion brings out soldiers’ pride and urges them to complete the final step between glory and themselves - defeating Calgacus’s army.

<p class="p1">
 	After the two commanders establish the incentives of war, they undertake different rhetoric strategies to excite soldiers. Calgacus, on one hand, continue to incite militancy through fear. He exemplifies a list of things the Britons may lose if they are defeated:  <em>Bona fortūnaeque in tribūtum, ager atque annus in frūmentum, corpora ipsa ac manūs silvīs ac palūdibus ēmūniendīs inter verbera et contumēliās conteruntur</em> (31.1). Using asyndeton between clauses, Calgacus builds momentum in his narrative and adds intensity to the horrible result where the Romans take away their basic rights to freedom and security. The lack of conjunctions implies that these will happen all at once if they lose the battle. By showing the numerous things at stake, he thus creates a sense of urgency and makes the soldiers eager to defend their own safety and freedom.
</p>

<p class="p1">
The Agricola, on the other hand, keeps bringing out soldiers’ pride as he reminds them of the hardships they have been through together. <em>Equidem saepe in agmine, cum vōs palūdēs montēsve et flūmina fatīgārent, fortissimī cuiusque vōcēs audiēbam: ‘quandō dabitur hostis, quandō manūs?’</em>(33.4). Here, Agricola personifies mountains, marshes, and rivers, as he sets as them the sentence's subject. By giving these natural obstacles human characteristics, Agricola implies that the challenge of overcoming these obstacles is equal to conquering mortal enemies, and since they have already overcome these natural enemies, he assures the soldiers that fighting the Britons would not be more challenging. Moreover, Agricola utilizes an alliteration of the “f” sound when he says <em>flūmina fatīgārent, fortissimī.</em> The first part of the alliteration bundle stresses the degree of challenge posed by the natural obstacles. Then, <em>fortissimī</em> juxposes the these challenges by assuring the soldiers that they are the strongest and most willing to fight. By connecting two adversative clauses through alliteration, Agricola emphasizes the soldiers’ toughness and encourages them to focus on their strength and determination.
</p>

<p class="p1">
Finally, both commanders make arguments for the weakness of their enemies to give confidence to the soldiers. On the one hand, Calgacus argues that the Roman army was united by fear and enslavement, as it comprised many different races, Gauls, Germans, and some Britons. Then he uses epigrammatic expression to highlight their weakness: <em>metus ac terror est, īnfirma vincla cāritātis; quae ubi remōverīs, quī timēre dēsierint, ōdisse incipient </em>(32.2). The use of the epigram here furthers Calgacus’s claim that the Roman army displays deadly weakness as they are bonded by fear instead of loyalty. Through this epigram, Calgacus conveys his message to the audience concisely and memorably, as the epigram utilizes highly stylized language. For example, the assonance of the “a” sound in <em>īnfirma vincla cāritātis</em> draws the audience’s attention to the clause in order to emphasize how Roman soldiers are united by a fragile chain, which could be quickly shattered by defeat. Furthermore, the sentence also employs an antithesis at <em>quī timēre dēsierint, ōdisse incipient.</em> By intentionally changing the word order to parallel <em>timēre dēsierint</em> and <em>ōdisse incipient,</em> the anthesis communicates memorably and eloquently to emphasize that contention within Romans will lead to their defeat. Therefore, Calcagus’s use of epigrammatic expression succinctly testifies to Roman disunity, which gives the soldiers hope and longing for victory. 
</p>

<p class="p1">
 	Similarly, Agricola compares the British soldiers to cowardly animals to show his soldiers that victory is easily achievable. He establishes a metaphoric senario to illustrate his argument: <em>Quōmodo silvās saltūsque penetrantibus fortissimum quodque animal contrā ruēre, pavida et inertia ipsō agminis sonō pellēbantur,sīc ācerrimī Britannōrum iam prīdem cecidērunt, reliquus est numerus ignāvōrum et timentium</em>(34.2). By establishing the conquest in Britain as a venture into the forest and comparing barbarians to wild animals, Agricola conveys vivid imagery of all the brave animals dying while the cowardly ones stay back. The use of simile here subtly reduces the difficulty of their conquest, as it associates the battle with a hunt in the forest in the soldiers’ minds. The subtle insinuation here gives confidence to the soldiers as they fight these “cowardly animals.” Moreover, the sentence ends on a hendiadys of <em>ignāvōrum et timentium.</em> By describing the remaining British soldiers as both cowardly and timid, Agricola adds nuances and depth to his accusation of the Britons’ deadly weakness, thus accentuating his claim that victory favors the Romans.
</p>

<p class="p1">
In conclusion, the two commanders undertake different rhetorical strategies to prepare their soldiers for the critical battle, Calgacus through fear and Agricola through pride. They both give well-reasoned speeches that address why they should fight, what they are fighting for, and why they can win. Two equally eloquent speeches build tremendous tension between the Roman and the British armies prior to the battle, dramatizing the crash and making Agricola’s later victory appear more glorious.
