	<p class="passagetitle">A psychological examination on the murderers in Edgar Allan Poe's Writing</p>
	<p class="p1">Edgar Allan Poe, an influential romantic writer from America, was extremely talented in writing short stories that closely examine psychological activities of murderers, especially those who exhibit sociopathic traits. Poe’s writings often take the form of first person narratives, precisely capturing murderers’ self-examinations of their misconducts. This creative presentation creates a conversation between the readers and the narrators, leaving readers to judge the mentalities of the narrators by themselves. Three of Poe’s short stories, <em>The Tell-Tale Heart</em>, <em>The Black Catand</em> and <em>The Cask of Amontillado</em>, all portray the mental changes of narrators on accounts of their murders. In the stories, the narrators all defend their sanity as they narrate; they all reason their behaviors with analyses of their own mental states. Although their analyses appear to be surprisingly calm and reasonable, their sinister acts highlight the sociopathic problems that lay beneath their self-conscious minds. The narrators in the stories have distinct dispositions, and they also differ in mental stability, but it is detectable from their narrations that they share certain mental symptoms which may be the ultimate causes of their moral corruptions. 
 </p>
	<p class="p1">
	Despite the fact that the narrators claim different motivations for their killings, it is clear that their intentions display many similarities. Firstly, the narrators are all hypersensitive to things that common people often overlook. Those things are planted in their minds and slowly corrupt their sanities. When their minds remind them of the existence of those things, it often results in vehement outbursts of uncontrollable emotion. In the <em>The Tell-Tale Heart</em>, the narrator is deeply disturbed by the “pale blue eyes” of the old man, whenever the sight of whom “falls upon him, his blood runs cold. Therefore, he made up his mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid himself the eyes forever”. (74) And later on in the story, the itching sound of an old man’s heart beats become an annoyance for the narrator. As when he stands next to the old man’s bed, the “hideous” beating sound “increases his fury,” (76) which makes him more adamant in the thought of killing. Moreover, the ringing noises in his head that become louder and louder when he talks to the officers eventually put him into an outburst of rage. The imaginative noise, unheard by the officers, nudges him into insanity.

	<p class="p1">
		In the <em>Black Cat</em>, likewise, the black cat the narrator adopted becomes the disturbance for the narrators. After killing his former pet Pluto, the cat gradually became a phantom that haunted him. The adoption of the new cat signifies his attempt to retrieve his sobriety, however, it ends up tragically. “By slow degrees, his fondness toward the cat turns into disgust and annoyance, which rose into the bitterness of hatred.” (112) As the cat unremittingly follows the narrator, the footsteps of whom become the trigger to his evil thoughts. “The creature left him no moment alone,” haunted him relentlessly with “dreams of unutterable fear.” And “beneath the pressure of torments such as these, the feeble remnant of goods within him succumbed.” He starts to have “sudden, frequent, ungoverned outbursts of fury.” (113)  Eventually, in an attempt to kill the cat, he accidently buried an axe in his wife’s brain.

	<p class="p1">
		On the other hand, in <em>The Cask of Amontillado</em>, the narrator Montresor recalls a murder he committed half a century ago. Due to the long time that has passed by, his narrative describing his mental states is indeed unprecise. Montresor failed to capture his exact feelings and motivations of the killing; however, the fact that Montresor can still vividly recall the words, the gesticulation, dressings and even the jingling bell of Fortunato proves that Fortunato’s mere existence is a source of disturbance for the narrators. In short, the narrators, though committed the crime in different scenarios, all share the psychological symptoms that amplify tiny noises in their head, which slowly deteriorate their sanities and corrupt their moralities, and eventually push them into perverseness. 
	</p>
	<p class="p1">
	Beside the symptoms of hypersensitivity, the narrators also display inability to sympathize with fellow human beings, which can be validated by their lack of remorse after the crime. The murderers, instead of feeling guilt for actively taking responsibility for their immoral conduct, all show perceptions of pleasure from the killing. The narrator of <em>The Tell-Tale Heart</em> “smiled gaily to find the deed so far done,” while the narrator of <em>The Black Cat</em> “look around triumphantly” after successfully concealing the body, and the Montresor from <em>the Cask </em>“felt satisfied” (120) for his ingenious crime design. All of those instances show that the narrators gained instant pleasures from committing the crime, and reflect their mental disabilities to sympathize; they do not feel guilty for their murders. That is to say, this mental disability also contributes to their sociopathic behavior. 
	</p>
	<p class="p1">
	To conclude, all the narrators in these stories are ill. Their hypersensitivity and sociopathic mentality makes them extremely mentally unstable. And the emotional chaos they experienced gradually shakes their moral firmness. Finally, their commitments of murder symbolized the total destruction of their morality. And, as an aftermath of this destruction, the sanity of those narrators also collapse.

	The fire quenched. he woke up. The morning fog had soaked his blanket, but he was indifferent to the annoyance. He was tired, but he couldn't stop. The wind blew, and the embers in the ashes of the bonfire, scattered with flares, swirled, just like the flames in his heart. Destined to be restless, the traveler mounted his camel and resumed his quest.
