	<p class="passagetitle">Life Isn’t Just About Keeping Busy:Let's Face the Boredom</p>
	<p class="p1">
	( the following article is written for the 2020 New York Times editorial contest)
	</p>
	<p class="p1">There is a universal fear of boredom. Being bored can be a painful experience that exposes you to the emptiness of life and urges you to doubt the worth of your existence. I get that. Thanks to technology, we are able to escape from such torturous moments by diving into the digital world whenever we want. But after gaming or Netflixing all night, are we really fulfilled? Aren’t we just perpetually returning to those “now-what?” moments when tedium hits us even harder? It’s true: once you’re accustomed to fun on your phone, two minutes without it becomes forever. However, it’s impossible to always be plugged-in. In life, we can’t run away from boredom. Let’s just face it.  </p>
	<p class="p1">
	Boredom is not a defective emotion we have as humans. In fact, boredom can be blissful. It gifts us rare moments of self-reflection and rumination amid our mechanical daily routines.  It possesses a life-changing magic. I know it well because I have realized many major decisions and constructive ideas – from reorganizing room setups, to learning new skills, and exploring my identity – all while sitting through life’s boring moments. These revelations wouldn’t have been possible if my life was only busy and uninterrupted.
	<p class="p1">
	Moreover, research shows that boredom also enhances your creativity. The concept here is simple to grasp. When there is a lack of stimulation from the outside world, your brain produces stimulations itself, which amend your ability to dream with imaginative ideas. Of course, you don’t want to get bored to the point where there is absolutely no outside input. A life too solitary is dangerous and could lead to mental illness, namely hallucination. A bit of boredom combined with a bit of fun is necessary for creativity to flow. 
	</p>

	<p class="p1">
	Boredom also makes you happier. It lowers your expectation of fun and your standard of satisfaction. When there is nothing to do, playing chess can easily enlighten one’s day. But when there is too much to do, choosing the best among all becomes a conundrum. Ian Bogost views boredom as inspirational; “life’s limitations are not impediments to our enjoyment, but rather, what makes life or the game fun in the first place.” The unlimited possibility in the digital world blurs the limitation of our reality, whereas boredom makes it conceivable again, granting us long-lasting happiness and fulfillment. 
	</p>
	<p class="p1">
	At this special time when we are kept inside by Covid-19, don’t let your mind be dominated by screens. Take some time to get bored. Appreciate the fleeting changes, stillness, and wonder in the world around you. After all, boredom is a luxury for people who have free time to enjoy it.
