	<p class="passagetitle">Just Wage: A Kantian Analysis</p>
	<p class="p2"><b>The Following Essay is awarded High Commendation by John Locke institute during 2020 essay competition.</b></p>
	<p class="p2"><b>Research Question: Are there circumstances under which an employer has a moral duty to pay her employee more than they agreed in the employment contract? </b></p>
	<p class="p1">In the world of market economies, the wages of employees are often considered as the price of the labor. In other words, the employer pays employee wages to buy her time of labor. [1]Under this view, an employment contract signifies a trade made voluntarily by both sides, and therefore, to ensure equality for all, there is no such duty for an employer to pay her employee more than they agreed—most laws guaranteed this form of justice. However, moral justice is different from judiciary justice. Ethical justice outlines the perfect behavioral guidelines for people, while judiciary justice indicates the minimum standards.[2] A moral duty exists when the moral justice is yet to be attained. That is to say, when we talk about the moral duty of an employer, we should examine whether the employment contract has met certain moral principles. If there is any circumstance that a contract does not pass the ethical evaluation, then the answer to the question is yes, vice versa. 
	</p>
	<p class="p1">In this essay, I will argue from a Kantian point of view that unethical employment situations exist, and the employers of these companies have a moral responsibility to give employees a raise. To test my answer, I will divide my response into two parts. First, I will defend the validity of the Kantian theory in the realm of applied business ethics. Second, I will evaluate a seemingly unethical scenario using Kantian theory. The first part is important because truth cannot be testified if a theory itself is obviously questionable, same reason as a matter cannot be observed under an impaired microscope. After establishing Kantian ethics’ authority, the second part directly answers the question using deductive reasoning and exemplification. With both parts of the response, I hope I approach the answer with enough eloquence. 
</p>
	<p class="p1"><u>Kantian Theory in Applied Business Ethics</u></p>
	<p class="p1">
	At first glance, Kantian ethics may seem impossible to be applied in business ethics. Rooted in moral absolutism, Kantian ethics proposes a series of strict rules, namely categorical imperatives, to regulate people’s behaviors and decisions. Intuitively, those rigid principles seem to be unfitting in the world of free markets, where some underlying competition rules contradict Kantian maxims. For example, the ultimate goal of each firm in the field is to outcompete others and maximize the profit gain, which makes it tempting for the business to treat employees as a means instead of as an end.[3] Therefore, many doubts were voiced when it was first applied in the discussion of business ethics in the late twentieth century. The popular criticisms mainly revolve around two pillars, the need for principle-based moral judgment and, on the further end, the existence of principles. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	In order to understand these doubts, it is important to understand the historical context first. Aristotelian virtue ethics dominated the discussions on business ethics before the entrance of Kantian ethics. Aristotelian ethicists believe that a flexible theory must be adopted to adapt to the deepening complexity of the business environment. Aristotelian virtue ethics permits such flexibility as it utilizes case-based reasoning combining with casuistry in making an ethical decision. Therefore, when Kantian ethics was introduced, the Aristotelian “particularists” logically doubted the effectiveness and plausibility of the theory. [4] 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	The first criticism, namely the indeterminacy objection, argues that principle-based reasoning cannot adapt to the new situations as it only provides preliminary guidance in making a moral judgment.[5] And Kantian principles, as in application, are so ambiguous and impractical that “A seemingly endless series of problems arises when one attempts to derive from such principles as the categorical imperative or the principle of utility, solutions to ethical problems faced by business people.”[6] Given the vagueness, the critique questions whether one will ever be smart enough or sufficiently informed to make an undebatable judgment. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">The second notion relates to the first but goes further on the spectrum and argues that the principle does not even exist as the Kantian method of testifying principle is flawed. A generalizable principle is nonexistent because the critics believe a contradicting condition following an originally universalizable maxim can easily make it self-contradicting. That view of criticism is named <em>generalism objection.</em> [7]
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">Although two criticisms make different arguments, they all make the same conceptual mistake about Kantian ethics. That is to say, two criticisms can be rebutted at once. According to Kant, principles are not in a strict binary state of existence or nonexistence. In fact, it is exactly the point that the principles can be abstracted differently under different circumstances. The charm of the principles is that “they will carry some consequence in the midst of our deliberation about what to do in particular situations.”
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1"><u>Exploitive Wage and Moral Duty of the Employer</u>
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">The rising number of sweatshops characterizes the change of the economic structure of the modern world. The sweatshops have generated tremendous revenue for multinational enterprises as they are often established in second or third world countries where laborers are cheap. However, this new capitalist phenomenon was disputed by many as unethical since the workers’ welfare is often exploited and the wages are too low. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">Kantian ethics, which have proven to be effective in the section above, can provide a clear moral judgment on the issue. The second categorical imperatives of Kant clearly state that “Morality is the condition under which alone a rational being can be an end in himself because only through it is it possible to be a law giving member in the realm of ends. Thus, morality and humanity insofar as it is capable of morality, alone have dignity”[8]. Here, Kant argues that a rational being should never use people as a tool to achieve an end but rather respect them as people with dignity. In cases of sweatshops, the employer is suspicious of using workers as a means. However, before imprudently concluding the employer’s immorality and imposing a moral duty onto her, I need to further explain the definition of wage exploitation. In other words, when is a wage unjust.
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">According to The United Nations Development Program, a wage is unjust when it fails to meet the price of the food one needs to survive. The UN studied the basic caloric intake every adult needs to live a healthy life and calculated the lowest money to purchase such a basket of food. If a worker’s wage does not meet the standard, then the worker’s payment is deemed unjust.[9] For example, a Mexican employee of a sweatshop owned by Alcoa (aluminum company of America) earns between $21- $24 a week, while the study shows that the basic food items for a week cost $26.[10] In this case, the wage is unjust as it does not meet the standard. Hence, according to Kantian ethics, the employer is proven to treat the employee as a means instead of an end and therefore has a moral duty to pay more in order to meet the standards of justice. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1"><u>Conclusion</u>
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">According to Kantian Ethics, there are circumstances under which an employer has a moral duty to pay her employee more than they agreed on the employment contract. Sweatshops, for example, exemplify this unjustifiable wage. When an employer pays her employee an exploitive amount of wage that she cannot afford the basic need, the employer is acting unethically because she treats others as a means. Therefore, there is a moral duty imposed on her to raise the wage. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1"><u>Author’s note:</u>
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">Business ethics is a constantly evolving realm of study where the scenarios are regularly complicated. The issues are often debated on both normative and applied fronts. Kantian ethics is a contemporary theory on the rise. Deontology, as known as principle-based ethics, are not so welcomed in the realm of applied ethics. It was not until recently that the economic potential of Kantian ethics was realized. I hope my paper has provided an eloquent answer to the problem and demonstrated the potential of Kantian ethics in business judgment making.
