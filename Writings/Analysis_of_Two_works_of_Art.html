	<p class="passagetitle">Adam and Eve Under the Pens of Michelangelo And William Blake</p>
	<p class="p1">Michelangelo and William Blake are two masters from different time periods. Their influence has endured due to their remarkable artistic abilities and groundbreaking creativity. On the one hand, Michelangelo from Italy epitomized the Renaissance, displaying great versatility and producing countless sophisticated masterpieces. On the other hand, William Blake from England pioneered Romanticism in the 19th century, rejecting the concept of general beauty and redefining arts with his defiant individualism. Both artists have made an indelible mark on the history of art. Living in a religious world, both artists showed passion to portray stories from the bible as their specialties. However, their interpretations of the texts were distinct from each other. Two works that portray the story of Adam and Eve, <em>Original Sin</em> and <em>The Angel of Divine Presence</em>, manifest this distinction. 
	</p>
	<p class="p1">Michelangelo’s understanding of the Book of Genesis is represented by his work on the Sistine Chapel’s ceiling. <em>The Original Sin</em> is one of the frescoes on the Sistine chapel that depicts the story of Genesis. The work was commissioned to Michelangelo in 1508 during the peak of the Renaissance. The fresco portrays two scenes of Genesis: the temptation of Eve and the expulsion of Adam and Eve. The gestures of the characters and the use of light in the painting reflect Michelangelo’s comprehension of the story. Clearly, Michelangelo inserts his unique understanding in this highly allegorical piece of art. On the left of the painting where the serpent is luring Eve to consume the fruit, Eve sits innocently on a rock and receives the fruit from the serpent, while Adam, standing next to her, grabs the tree of the forbidden fruit and points at the serpent in an accusatory manner. Here, Michelangelo recreated the scene of temptation. In the original text, there is no direct exchange between Adam and the serpent, but the scene here shows Adam standing gallantly against sinfulness while Eve accepts the fruit. On the right, Adam and Eve are expelled out of the garden by an angry cherubim. In this scene, Adam powerlessly pushes away the angry cherubim and his sword, while Eve, looking defeated and withered, stands next to him and tries to shy away from the attack. In the middle, Michelangelo was inspired by Echidna in Hesiod’s <em>Theogony</em> and metamorphosed the serpent into half snake half human to demonstrate the Sin's binary nature as “fair above, false below.”

	As it is named, the main motif of the painting is the Original Sin. In Michelangelo’s understanding, the Garden of Eden was not a utopian paradise free from sin but rather a sinful place where dwellers were simply ignorant to reality. Evidence of his perspective is demonstrated by the contrast between left and right. On the left, Eden is unconventionally depicted as a rocky and barren place. A traditional Renaissance portrayal of Eden would usually be vivacious and exuberant. But here, Michelangelo characterized Eden with dark green ground, various rocks, a dead tree stump, and a fading shadow on the far-left edge, suggesting the blinding nature of Eden. In contrast to the left, the world on the right seems more open and free, as the color becomes brighter. Therefore, the depressing looks on Adam and Eve’s faces as they exit are not regretful for being punished, but rather pained from the realizations of their instinctive, unsalvageable sins.

	The Angel of the Divine Presence by William Blake reflects a largely different understanding of the text. The watercolor piece was commissioned to Blake in 1809 by his private patron, Thomas Butts. The works depicts the scene when “the Lord God made garments of skins for the man and for his wife, and clothed them.” In this painting, God, dressed all in white, stands in the middle while Adam and Eve pray under his arms. On the sides of the painting there are palm trees and fire. The scene happens amidst the judgment when God punishes Adam and Eve for their misconduct, but there is no sign of anger on God’s face and there is no sign of remorse on Adam’s and Eve’s faces. God appears to be calm and merciful while Adam and Eve look pious and peaceful. The gesture of God embracing Adam and Eve make him seem exceptionally loving. Normally, when reading the story of Adam and Eve, people tend to think God is furious upon discovering the wrongful acts of his children and punishes them with physical and mental pain. Yet Blake focuses on the line in which God makes Adam and Eve garments to show his forgiveness and mercifulness. The harmonious depiction of the judgement reflects Blake’s belief that God does not blame Adam and Eve for what they have done, but rather pities them for what they have discovered: the heavy truth about knowledge.

	It is difficult to determine which interpretation is better. There is insinuated gender inferiority in Michelangelo’s work, as the evil serpent is personified as a woman instead of a man. Moreover, the withered look on Eve’s face upon exiting suggests that Eve is guilty for her curiosity, with original sin dwelling in her. Although Michelangelo’s intention was not to demean women, his depiction encourages people to associate original sin with women and therefore establishes unequal gender roles. On the other hand, Blake’s interpretation was skewed by John Milton’s biblical-inspired epic poem, Paradise Lost. Blake created illustrations for Paradise Lost prior to this commission, in which Eve was deceived by Satan and God did not blame Adam or Eve for violating his rule. The Angel of Divine Presence was clearly influenced by John Milton’s interpretation of the story. Therefore, Blake’s portrayal exhibits less originality compared to Michelangelo’s. However, from an artistic standpoint, I prefer Blake’s work of art. I value his bravery to challenge conventions, and I revere the brimming expressiveness in art. Therefore, I think Blake’s painting is slightly better.
