	<p class="passagetitle">Religious Exemption and the Death of Matthew Swan -- Is the Law Morally Right?</p>
	<p class="p1">(The details of Matthew Swan's Case can be found <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1980/01/02/rights-or-rites-our-familys-painful-change-of-heart/bec4a6a7-8f9d-40d2-aaba-76461a5c20d7/">Here</a>)</p>
	<p class="p1">Christian Scientists  believe that “illness is caused by sin and can only be healed by prayer.” (42) A Christian Scientist, thus, is instructed not to seek medical care when he or she is ill. The doctrine sounds almost heretical to the modern main-stream perspective, and it has, as expected, generated problems. As the case in the book indicates, young Matthew Swan died at the age of sixteen-months because his parents, Rita and Douglas Swan, both life-long Christian Scientists, failed to seek medical care for him on time when he was suffering from a ravaging case of meningitis. Matthew missed his optimal opportunity for treatment because a Christian Science practitioner falsely instructed his parents that the illness was caused by their negative feelings, and prescribed them with more prayers. Matthew was already death-threatened when they finally decided to see a doctor, and he still passed away after a week of intensive medical care. Matthew’s death is not the only fatality under Christian Science’s doctrine; roughly 170 similar cases were reported in the past twenty five years. Those cases sparked a moral discussion: is it morally justified to have exemption laws that permit followers of  religions such as Christian Science  not to seek medical care for their children? 
</p>
	<p class="p1">
	It is morally wrong for Swans and Beagleys not to seek  medical attention for their children when they are threatened by death, especially when Matthew had not decided to be a Christian Scientist himself.  By not seeking medical help, the parents are imposing their own beliefs onto their children. It is understandable that parents want to pass on  their beliefs to their children, however, in cases that involves the life and death of the children, parents should reconsider their decision. Although it is morally wrong for parents not to send their children to a hospital, it is not totally their fault. Christian Science itself is an idealistic belief that sees  reality as spiritual rather than material. It is difficult for one whose ideology is based on spiritual reality to recognize how the world works physically. Given those special conditions, it is clear that parents are struggling between the constraints of their own religious belief and the heath of their children. Without a doubt, life and health outweighs any other values, therefore the parents should prioritize the health of their children. But both Christian Science and the medical system are intended to save life. How should the parents choose? Statistically, the medical system is far more effective in curing diseases, because of its roots in empirical experiments. So, in cases where one single mistreatment might lead to extreme consequence, parents ought to choose the treatment that has a better chance of saving Matthew.

	<p class="p1">
	Moreover, the exemption law that gives sanctuary to religions like Christian Science is not morally justifiable. Although it is understandable that society wants to respect people with different beliefs and enhance social inclusiveness, according to a utilitarian point of view, the consequences that may possibly derive from practicing such religion (such as the death of children) are  too intense, therefore the law ought not be promoted. The duty of a society is to secure the life and safety of its residents; in no way should it sanction the law that leads to the deaths of 170 innocents. Religion can instruct the parents not to seek medical care for themselves, but it cannot arbitrarily deprive the rights of those fragile children to seek other solutions when they are threatened by death. Therefore, society ought to step in and forbid the practice when a religion imposes its impact on the children.
