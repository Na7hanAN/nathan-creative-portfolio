	<p class="passagetitle">My View of Materialist+Soul Survival: An Rebuttal Against Soul-Swapping Argument</p>

	<center><p class="p1"><b> (1) </b> </p></center>
	<p class="p1">
	The Soul-swapping Argument challenged my belief and made me rethink my stance on survival. 
	</p>
	
	<center><p class="p1"> <b>(2) </b></p></center>
	<p class="p1">
	Coming into the class, my conception of survival leans toward a combination of materialist and soul survival. I believe that a soul cannot live without a material body, and a body cannot come to life without a soul: the body and soul are interdependent. 
	A material body is essential for survival because it connects a consciously living thing to the physical world. In my view, the brain is considered a part of the material body because it also comprises physical particles - atoms, electrons, protons, and neutrons. That is to say, human memories and consciousness are also materialistic things since they are formed through the interactions between neurons. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	Besides my materialist view, I also support the existence of an immaterial soul. I came to this view through the near-death experience I had. When I was around six, I passed out one time due to suffocation. Unlike other near-death stories I heard from my peers, I did not feel my consciousness flying away from my body; I felt absolute peace. My friend’s dad told me that my heart stopped for a few seconds. My physical body had ceased functioning for a few seconds, yet my ability to come back alive signified that my survival did not solely depend on my material body. Since then, I came to the belief that I do have an immaterial soul.
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	Contrary to popular opinion, I believe that my soul does not govern how I think nor causally interact with my consciousness. My soul is like a token that signifies my unique survival - it is the core of my being. The relationship between my body and soul is similar to that between a license plate and a car. My soul, in this case, is the license plate, and my body is the car. The license plate indicates ownership and the uniqueness of the car, while the mechanical body gives function to the car. A car is incomplete without either the license plate or the mechanical body. Likewise, my soul and body are also interdependent. My immaterial soul is an irreplaceable and irreproducible token of my being, and my material body gives meaning to my physical survival. 
	</p>

	<p class="p1">
	The argument of Soul-Swapping questioned the existence of an immaterial soul and challenged my view of survival. I was eventually unconvinced by the argument and held on to my original belief. 
	</p>
	
	<center><p class="p1"> <b>(4)</b> </p></center>
	<p class="p1">
	The Soul-Swapping argument takes on an evidentialist perspective, proposing that the immaterial soul is nonexistent because of its lack of evidence. This view initially shook my belief as I often adopt evidentialist methodology in forming an argument. But after careful consideration, I realized the flaw in its evidentialist logic and formed a rebuttal against it.
	</p>
	
	<center><p class="p1"><b> (4.1) </b></p></center>
	<center><p class="p1"><b> Rejection of Premise Four </b></p></center>
	<p class="p1">
	Premise four of the Soul-Swapping Argument utilizes an evidentialist logic, viz. If you have no evidence which rules something out, you should not believe its opposite. To refute this premise, let me begin by telling a possible scenario: 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	Ben was a patient with a terminal disease. No one had ever survived this disease. Ben knew that he was going to die. Ben’s family and friends love Ben; they wish him to be optimistic and want him to believe that he can beat the disease. Ben’s doctor also comforted him by telling him that optimism can increase his chance of surviving the illness - a hypothesis that was never validated or testified by any researcher. The love and support from Ben’s family and friends empowered Ben. He decided to be optimistic and trusted that he could survive the disease, despite the lack of evidence in his belief. Before he passed away in peace. He fought the illness optimistically for three years, long exceeding his expected lifetime.
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	Through this story, I formulated the following argument against the premise: 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	<b>The Optimism Argument against Evidentialist Premise. </b>
	<ol>
		<li>If you believe you will survive from a terminal disease, then you are being optimistic</li>
		<li>Being optimistic is good for you. </li>
		<li>If something is good for you, then you should do it.</li>
		<li>You should believe you will survive the terminal disease. (1,2,3)</li>
		<li>You believe you will die from the disease.</li>
		<li>If you believe that you will survive, you believe in the opposite of your belief. (4,5)</li>
		<li>There is no evidence suggesting that you will survive your disease.</li>
	</ol>
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	<br> C. If you have no evidence which rules something out, you can still believe its opposite. (4,6,7)
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	My optimism argument essentially refutes premise four by saying that you can believe in something despite the lack of evidence, especially if the thing is worthy of faith or has potential for high benefit. The conclusion, therefore, states that you can still believe in the opposite of your current view even if there is no evidence ruling your view out. The conclusion is derived from premises four, six, and seven. The premises(4,5,7) together put forth a case that directly refutes the Premise Four of Soul-Swapping argument, asserting that even if you have no evidence ruling out your belief of certain death, you can still believe your likelihood of survival. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	In the optimism argument, premises two and three are the most contentious ones. So I am here offering further explanations and defenses for my premises. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	First, I argue that being optimistic is good for you (premise 1), by which I mean that optimism has the potential to enhance your chance of survival from the disease. Although there is no empirical or scientific evidence, the faith you invest in optimism is good for you as it fosters a sense of happiness and courage, which your loved ones cherish. Therefore, for the sake of potential benefit and the wills of your loved ones, optimism is a good alternative for pessimistic determinism. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	Second, I argue in premise two that If something is good for you, then you should do it. Here, by using the prescriptive verb “should,” I indicate that the premise contains moral truth. In all moral theories, goodness is unanimously desirable -- every moral theory aims to foster goodness for individuals and society. The opponent of this premise might utilize a utilitarian scope and argue that you should not do everything that is good for you, especially when it comes with a downside. The opponent might provide a case that eating drunk food is good for your mental health, yet it comes with problems such as obesity. So in some scenarios, you should not eat drunk food even though it is good for your mental health. I believe this argument has some truth value, yet it cannot wholly reject my premise as I can easily make a slight twist to address the rejection. I can amend the premise by changing it to that (3) If something is undoubtedly good for you, then you should do it. To adjust this change, I will also amend my premise two to that (2)Being optimistic is undoubtedly good for you. In this way, I address the counterargument by further arguing that there is no obvious downside to having an optimistic attitude, which is undoubtedly good for you. This slight change will reject the aforementioned counterargument.

	<center><p class="p1"><b> Why is my original stance more likely to be true?</b></p></center>
	
	<p class="p1">
	By rejecting premise four of the Soul-Swapping Argument, I invalidated the argument and defended my original view of M+S survival. I believe that my stance regarding M+S is sound due to 1) the apparent flaw in other survival views, 2) the plausibility of my belief in fitting into future-predicting works (literature, TV shows, and movies), and 3)the recent development in information technology. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	First, the other survival worldviews contain apparent flaws. For instance, one may argue against a materialist view by saying that your body part is constantly changing, and there isn’t a determining factor that can define your survival according to the materialist view. For psychological survival, one may argue that the memories can be codified or modified using contemporary technology. If your memories are not what you historically experienced, it will be hard to define what is actually you. The core problem with these viewpoints is that there isn’t a deterministic factor that indicates your singleness and uniqueness. Modern technologies are advancing at a rapid speed. The appearances of cloning technology, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, robotics body parts all challenged the uniqueness of our survival. Therefore, I came to the position that life is a combination of a material body and an immaterial soul. The material body governs our consciousness. And the immaterial soul serves as a token that reminds us of our uniqueness and our ownership of the body. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	I believe that my stance provides answers to numerous questions raised by Sci-Fi movies and books. One big question is that if, in the future, you duplicate and upload your consciousness into a virtual reality, which consciousness is you? For this question, my view would explain that the online consciousness is a copy of your brain, yet it does not possess a soul, which is key to your survival. Therefore, the living person in the physical reality is the real you. In this way, my view of M+S can provide faith to people who fear losing their unique identity to future technologies and provide an important scope for future law and policy makers to manage our world under technology developments. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	A recent development in information technology has supported my view, namely, the NFTs. The NFT stands for non-fungible tokens, which evolved from the blockchain. Through using a non-fungible key and the unanimous recognition of blockchain computers, a piece of digital art can be singularly possessed by a real-life person. For NFTs, a person may duplicate its vector property yet cannot alter its ownership or uniqueness. The concept of NFT is similar to my notion of survival - the body part, memory, or consciousness can be modified or duplicated using technology, yet the replicants lack a soul that makes it human. That is to say, the concept of NFTs sheds light on how my notion of survival may become more and more applicable in the increasingly digitized world.
	</p>
	
	
	<p class="p1">
	To conclude, my view of M+S survival is more likely to be true than false because of the fallibility of other notions, the plausibility of my belief in the context of futurist works, and support from NFT’s concept.
