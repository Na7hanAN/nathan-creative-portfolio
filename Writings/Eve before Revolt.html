	<p class="passagetitle">The Eve before the Revolt</p>
	<p class="p1" align="center">(The following passage is a writing based on the story Benito Cereno by Herman Melville)
	<p class="p1">On the deck,“tonight shall be the night,” Babo solemnly whispered to a group of negroes sitting in a circle. Among them are Atufal, José, Francesco, Dago, Ghofan and Yan. Although he was speaking in his native tone, and the noise of the dining crowd totally covered up his volume, he still put forth these words with great caution. 
	</p>
	<p class="p1">
	Before being captured and enslaved many years ago, Babo was a man of nature. He was verile, confident and simple. Despite his mediocre stature, he was able to run unstoppably under the blazing sun of Senegal and fight relentlessly against local enemies for his tribe. Countless people died under the spear of this brave warrior. There were rumors that the crimson birthmark on his inner thigh was in fact stained by the blood of people he had slain. But a fiasco destroyed him. His tribal enemy unashamedly partnered and conspired with Spanish colonizers, who massacred Babo’s tribe and family with canons and bayonets. Babo and his six years old sister survived. Discovered by Spaniards, they were chained and exported as slaves. Babo was traded to Chile, but his sister was sold to a different place. Babo, suffering from the tragic loss, forced himself to observe and learn the filthy complexity of the civilized world. In his ten years tenure as a slave, his naturalness had forever departed him and left him with a dangerous quietness and two revengeful eyes. 
	</p>

	<p class="p1">“Got it,” the party responded to Babo’s call sullenly. Each one of them perceived the message with a pensive look. Their hearts pounded fast. The food on their plates were uneaten.
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	“Have you gotten any weapon? ” Babo asked José. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	“There are two hachets in Aranda’s cabin, I can sneak those out when he falls asleep. I also got some handspikes from the basement.” José reported. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	“Good. Francesco, Dago, you two need to keep an eye on Juan Robles and Juan Gayete. They are on watch tonight. They are easy targets. Gayete cares more about his woodworks than our boat and Robles always fell asleep on the watch. As soon as they start getting lazy, you two should inform us and we will launch the attack,” continued Babo, “after dinner the rest of you go tell every fighter to get ready. Be cautious, don’t let any sailor or mate overhear your conversations. And do not let those nonparticipants, women and children know our plan.” 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	The party replied with a solemn glance. Babo leaned forward, “the wind is getting low. It is going to be a peaceful night,” then he added, “but certainly not a peaceful night for us.” 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	Babo put his black fist forward.  “For freedom.” 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	The group followed, “for freedom!”
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	It was a November night in the Caribbean. The moon rises early in the evening, giving stars no chance to shine. As the evening breeze gradually died down, Captain Aranda commanded sailors to hail the canvases and ordered them to get a good sleep on this windless night. The ship floated on top of the mazarine of caribbean sea like a swinging crib. The sun slowly slipped down the horizon as the negroes and sailors were wrapping up their dinner. For a short moment, the scattered cumulus clouds above San Dominick were ignited by the setting sun like ablazing cottons. The natural marvels continued as the moon replaced the sun and enlightened the night. It was a full moon. With the corona surrounding it, the moon cast silver rays onto San Dominick and negroes’ faces. For this whole year, the entire world celebrated the coming of a new century, a new age, and this hopeful excitement had also reached those negroes on the ship. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	While San Dominick fell asleep gently under the silver moon light, Babo and his fellow rioters lay awake on the deck. They quietly waited for the signal. In the tedium, the serenity of the night placed Babo into streaming recollection. He recalled his childhood, his parents, his friends, his first love and his sister. He felt lost. He felt lost quite often over his years as a slave. Whenever he has time alone, he entertains himself by recalling memories. And when his detached memories juxtaposed with his current livings, the sense of surreality created by which fueled his eagerness of returning home and reconnecting with his roots. Now, it is time for him to fight for his fate.
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	Babo’s fellow rioters lie scattered among the crowd of sleeping negroes. Each of them, akin to Babo, were in quiet contemplation. Surely they were thinking of their loved ones, their tragedy that led them here, and their longing for freedom. With these thoughts, their hearts pounded faster and faster.
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	Around two o’clock, José returned to Babo with the handspikes and hatchets. He cautiously distributed it to the party. The party stayed still for another hour before Dago came down from the mast and informed them that Roble fell asleep and Gayete was absorbed into his woodworks. The party knew that the time has come. Atufal breathed heavily. Vengeance filled his eyes with blood. He tiptoed to the cockpit with a hatchet, where two distracted watchmen stayed. The moon gradually exited from the horizon, leaving San Dominick in total darkness. With the sounds of cracking bones and hysterical shriek, a gory and vengeful night unfolded. 
	</p>
	
	<p class="p1">
	Next morning, when the sun took over the darkness, the gruesomeness of the battle became visible. With the enlightening sun rays, the crowd has fully awakened. They saw the folded canvases covered with blood. They saw the parts of the human body, both black and white, fingers, hands, feet, limbs, heads, scattered on the deck. They saw those whitemen tied and chained, one by one thrown overboard. With the rising sun, the crowd was filled with triumphant joy. They burst into a euphoric celebration of their liberty. They chanted and danced. The excitement for the new millennium permeated every heart.
