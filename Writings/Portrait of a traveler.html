	<p class="passagetitle">Portrait of a Traveler</p>
	<p class="p1">In a vast desert, there lay an ancient traveler and his old camel. Curled up in a thin crimson blanket, the traveler gazed into the campfire next to him, nearly every furrow in his weather-beaten face suddenly visible in the dim light. The flames reflected in his eyes, decorating his hollow pupils with unfathomable melancholy and making one hard to distinguish whether it was flames that glow or the heart that burns. He lay quietly, curled in his blanket, his thoughts displaced, leaving him blind even to the celestial marvels clustered in the dark canopy over his head. Gradually, his eyelids grew heavy. He closed his eyes, and gently, he dreamed. </p>
	<p class="p1">
	Ever since he was a pearl in his crib, he had dreamt of a city. And he came to believe fanatically, as he watched the city in his dreams change over time—just as he changed and grew—that it was a message from God. Each night, the city appeared slightly different than the night before. Over the years, he witnessed the construction of three Gothic cathedrals; the paving of the streets; the refurbishment of plazas; the fall of leaves in autumn and their return in spring; the arrival of caravans and ships. He saw tailors and perfumers set up shop; saw the young celebrate their birthdays and maids celebrate their weddings; witnessed the destruction of castles and the rise of new regimes. The only thing that remained unchanged about the city in his dreams was the foreignness he felt as he imagined himself ambling across the city; he saw the raindrops on the triangular windows, walked down endless spiral staircases, overheard the sweet exchanges of young loves, and yet he stood apart. Feeling displaces of place was exactly how he liked it: he could escape from the constraints of rules and etiquette that way, and remain peaceful and free. He craved this foreignness.

	<p class="p1">
	As a handsome youth, the traveler had had an admirable life, immersed in love and knowledge. On the day he turned eighteen, he suddenly decided to leave his old life behind and, convinced that the city in his dreams existed, set off on his search. For the past fifty years, he had traveled the continents and the seas, ventured to the remotest caverns of the world, hoping to reach his destination. Many times he thought he had come close to it:  On an tropical island, under a granite cliff, in a bamboo forest, next to a river, He had found cities that granted him the same sense of isolation, but every time, he would eventually grow weary of them, his eyes tired with the scenes around him and his fantasies and imaginations depleted, and he had to leave.

	The fire quenched. he woke up. The morning fog had soaked his blanket, but he was indifferent to the annoyance. He was tired, but he couldn't stop. The wind blew, and the embers in the ashes of the bonfire, scattered with flares, swirled, just like the flames in his heart. Destined to be restless, the traveler mounted his camel and resumed his quest.
