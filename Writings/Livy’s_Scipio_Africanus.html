	<p class="passagetitle">Livy’s Scipio Africanus: Embodiment of an Ideal Commander
    </p>
    
     <p class="p1">
        The great Roman commander Scipio Africanus defeated Rome’s biggest nemesis Hannibal in 202 BC, ending the decades-long Second Punic War. Hundred years later, historian Livy authored the war and Scipio’s victorious deeds in <em>Ab Urbe Condita</em>, portraying Scipio as an icon of Roman virtues - skillful, manly, and deliberate. By contrasting Scipio to Hannibal and demonstrating his military manipulations in battles, Livy, with embellished lines, emphasizes his manliness and presents him as a brilliant commander both in leading the soldiers and maneuvering them in battles.

     <p class="p1">
        To understand Livy’s characterization of Scipio, it is essential to first look at Scipio’s response to Hannibal during their talk before the battle of Zama, a speech fully fictionized by Livy. In the speech, Scipio responds to Hannibal’s peace talk with short yet uncompromising words, accusing Hannibal of acting unmanly and insisting on his stance on war.
    </p>
    
     <p class="p1">
        Livy begins Scipio’s speech with a rising tricolon: “et humanae infirmitatis memini et uim fortunae reputo et omnia quaecumque agimus subiecta esse mille casibus scio” (line 1 – Face to Face B). In this strong sentence, Scipio replies to Hannibal’s long discussion of failing fortune with positive introspection, confidently stating that he has remembered human weakness, thought over the force of fortune, and knows the fickleness of chances. The rising tricolon compacts all his responses in a single sentence, emphasizing his decisiveness and contrasting him to Hannibal, who addresses him in a wishy-washy manner for a while. Then, Scipio accuses Hannibal of acting evasively, and he bonds to him with no respect: “nulla sum tibi verecundia obstrictus” (line 9). Again, Scipio’s attitude is contrasted with that of Hannibal. And by utilizing an interlocking word order, Livy highlights this confidence in Scipio’s words, further adding to his manly portrayal of Scipio. Finally, Scipio’s short but firm response ends on a strong note when he demands Hannibal to prepare for war because Hannibal cannot endure peace: “pacem pati no potuistis”(line 15). The consonance of “p” sounds here accentuates Scipio’s uncompromising attitude toward Hannibal and his determination to fight him. That is to say, in Livy’s mind, Scipio excels in both manliness and decisiveness, which are valuable characteristics of a commander.

        Livy further contrasts the virtues of the two commanders later in the passage when they return to their camps and prepare for the final battle. At first, Livy adopts a parallel narrative to show their preparation for war and both commander’s mastery skill in managing their army. As Scipio and Hannibal return to their own camps, they ask the soldiers to prepare for war: “pronuntiant ambo arma expedirent milites animosque ad supremum certamen” (line 5 – Zama A). The commanders ask their armies to not only prepare for the arms, but also get ready mentally for the ultimate match. A zeugma is used here for the verb “expedirent,” as it takes both of the subjects “arma” and “animos,” one word placed in the front and one after. The choice zeugma shows the awareness of the commanders as they both know it takes not only equipment, but also unyielding spirits to win a battle of this great importance. Then, after they are ready, Livy describe the two commanders as “duorum opulentissimorum populorum duo longe clarissimi duces, duo fortissimi exercitus” (line 15). By enclosing the main clause, “two most distinguished commanders by far,” with two genitives, the sentence forms a word picture that the commanders are backed by two greatest people and two strongest armies, further foreshadowing how competitive this battle would be.

     <p class="p1">
        Eventually, the narrative breaks off when it comes to the pep talks. Through their speech before the battle, Livy contrasts Scipio’s charisma to Hannibal’s cruelty, portraying Scipio’s righteous leadership while reminding people of Hannibal’s barbarity. To boost the spirit, both commanders recall the collective pasts with their soldiers. Hannibal, on the one hand, recalled the war they made and the many Roman commanders and soldiers “killed by annihilation,” an account so cruel that it almost confirms Scipio’s accusation of their innate treachery “insita animis perfidia” (line 30). On the other hand, Scipio prepares the soldiers by reminding them what’s at stake: their “reditum domum in patriam ad parentes liberos coniuges penatesque deos”(line 33). Here, the subjects are packed in a sentence without conjunctions. The use of asyndeton highlights the intensity of Scipio’s speech and reflects his ability to incite others' emotions. When Scipio speaks, “his body erects, and he shows such a happy expression that one may think the victory is already his”(line 34). By showing the expression of Scipio as he speaks and using hyperbole to emphasize his excitement, Livy paints a vivid picture of Scipio brilliantly lifting soldiers’ morale before the battle, contrasting to Livy’s short and plain description of Hannibal. Therefore, while both commanders are brilliant, Livy’s description of Scipio’s pep talk differentiates him from Hannibal in terms of virtue and charisma.

        Virtues and manliness alone cannot make an ideal commander. Skills in maneuvering the army during battles also matter. As an ideal Roman commander, Scipio was also talented in manipulating his army in the war, rapidly adapting to the ever-changing situation with deliberate and assertive commands. For example, when he confronted Hasdrubal’s army in Spain, the battle was undecided for a long time. However, when Hasdrubal gave the first sign of retreat, Scipio immediately reacted: “Scipio patefactisque ordinibus equitatum omnem leuemque armaturam in medium acceptam diuisamque in partes duas in subsidiis post cornua locat”(line 18 – The End in Spain B). Here, Scipio commands all cavalry and infantry to be taken into the middle, divided into two, and set in reserve. To emphasize the orderly command of Scipio, Livy adopts a chiasmus. By putting “in medium acceptam” in the front and followed by “divisamque in partes duas,” Livy utilizes the symmetry of the sentence to help readers visualize Scipio’s army arrangement, as if the army actually divided into two in front of them.  Thus, the chiasmus reflects and testifies to Scipio’s mastery of military manipulation, reinforcing his quality as a deliberate commander.
    </p>
    
     <p class="p1">
        Overall, under Livy’s pen, Scipio Africanus is a model Roman commander that embodies manliness, deliberation, and charisma. He emphasizes Scipio and his character through numerous stylistic embellishments and syntactical arrangements. By contrasting him and Hannibal, who is equal in his military skills and achievement, Scipio’s eventual victory becomes especially valuable and sends the message that Roman values always excel despite how great the difficulties are.
