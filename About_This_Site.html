		<b>About This Site</b>
	</p>
	<p> 
	This Site is designed, programed, and managed by Nathan alone using Photoshop, Adobe Dreamweaver and Hostgator. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Nathan is a student at St. George's school in RI. He enjoys learning new things and taking things classy, and this is why he decided to build his website using tradition, old-but-gold way -- Html+Css+Java programming. (A very useful skill to have!)
