	<p class="passagetitle">About This Site</p>
	<p> 
		     This website is designed, programed, and managed by Nathan using Photoshop, VScode, and Github repository. Nathan does not like how slow and irresponsive of many free website design tools such as wix and weebly, so he decided to create this site using the most classic way -- HTML + CSS + Java
	</p>

	<p>
		     The purpose of this portfolio is to document Nathan's various creative undertakings, so that it not only provides gateway for you to get to know him, but also serves as a valuable archieve for Nathan to review and remember his past works. 
	</p>

	<p>
		     This protfolio was first created in 2020 during Covid-19 quarantine, when Nathan was a student at St. George's school in RI. He is now a student at University of Notre Dame studying Classics and Economics. 
	Nathan enjoys learning new things and multi-media story telling, that is why he spends his freetime juggling with creative tools such as Finalcut Pro, Adobe Dreamweaver, Indesign, Photoshop, ArcGIS, Sketchup, Colab, ChatGPT, and so on.
